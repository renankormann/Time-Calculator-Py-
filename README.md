This is a project that that works similarly to a timer. The function "add_time" has three paramaters: 'begin' which would be the time that counting should start,
'addtime' is the time that will be added to the initial time, and 'day' is an optional parameter that is the starting day of the time. If 'day' is passed by the user, the
program will provide on which day the elapsed time will fall.
